### “Why get a job when you can make an app that lists them instead?” – probably me

## What is this abomination? 🫠

#### HireMePlz is basically a catalog of jobs for the lazy, the curious, and the slightly insane.

- Wanna see all the jobs humans pretend they like? 

- Wanna judge which careers are too common or secretly legendary? 

- Wanna feel like a career overlord while sipping coffee in your pajamas? 

### Features for the unemployed like us 🤪

- #### Full CRUD chaos: Create, Read, Update, Delete — yes, delete. Sometimes deleting is the best choice.

- #### Rarity system: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary. Because some jobs are actually god tier (imo ofcourse).

- #### Popularity stats: Know exactly how many other human beings are cooked with their field.

- #### Retro, pixel-like UI: Pixel icons, confetti, hover animations, maybe even some cursed colors.

- #### Add, edit, or delete jobs: Quickly manage everything without overthinking it.

### Tech Stack (because people ask)

- #### Backend: Laravel 12 – because I like feeling professional even though I’m still a noob at this stack

- #### Frontend: Tailwind CSS + Vanilla JS (vuejs can wait, and im not doing allat rn)

- #### Database: MySQL/MariaDB
